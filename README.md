# RBF-DQ

Solving Advection-diffusion Equation with Local Radial Basis Function-based Differential Quadrature Method

## How to run

- First, you need to run [`Knot_Generation.py`](src/Knot_Generation.py) to generate the knots needed by solving the equations.
- Second, run [`Main.py'](src/Main.py) to solve the equations.
